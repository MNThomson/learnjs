# What is JavaScript

JavaScript is commonly used to make websites interactive by responding to user actions such as clocks or keypresses. It runs directly in a web browser, making it easy to test and implement on any website. This ability to interact with users allows developers to manipulate web content, such as changing text, images, and videos on a page. In addition to enhancing user experience on the front end, JavaScript is a versatile language that extends beyond web development. It can also be used for backend programming and mobile app development, making it an essential tool in modern software development.
