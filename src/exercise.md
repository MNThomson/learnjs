Now that you’re familiar with the basics of programming in JavaScript, it’s time for you to try writing your first larger program. Your task is given a temperature in celsius, convert it to both Fahrenheit and Kelvin and then use `console.log` to output your answer. Remember to use variables, math, and functions in your solution. Good luck!

```js,playground,editable
// Convert this temperature into Fahrenheit and Kelvin
const temperatureInCelsius = 27

// Now write the rest of your code below here…
```
