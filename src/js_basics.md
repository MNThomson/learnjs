# JavaScript Basics
Ok, so let’s actually write a “program”. A simple program would be on that just says “hello” back, so let’s do that!

```js,playground
console.log("Hello")
```

Now when you click the "run" button, we should see the output "Hello". So what’s actually going on then and how does this work? Well, that’s what the rest of this lesson will teach you! For now, try changing the code, re-running the program, and see what happens.

To start your Javascript learning adventure, let’s take a look at the most basic program we can write: A program that prints out the words “Hello World”

```js,playground
console.log("Hello")
```

`console.log()` is one of the most frequently used operations in javascript, and it is used to print out information from our program. It prints whatever lies inside of the brackets. In our case, its the text “Hello World”. We wrap the text in quotes to indicate that it is text and not code, which in Javascript is called a string.

There are quite a few data types in javascript, but the 3 main ones are numbers, strings, and booleans.

Strings, like the “Hello World” above, are essentially lines of text, represented by the quotations. Single quotes or double quotes can be used to represent a string.

Numbers are, well, numbers. They can just be written as one would type out a number (ex: 5)
Booleans are values that are always true or false. These are represented with the keywords true and false.

You’ll also notice that we ended our line with a semicolon. In JavaScript (and most programming languages), all lines of code should be ended with a semicolon to show its the end of the line.

The last core concept to understand is code comments, denoted with a `//`. Comments are for writing things in our file without having our computer think its supposed to be code. Comments are often used to describe what certain code does or provide other background information on the code.

```js,playground
console.log("Hello World");
// Prints the text “Hello World”
```
