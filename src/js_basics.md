# JavaScript Basics
Ok, so let’s actually write a "program". A simple program would be on that just says `hello` back, so let’s do that!

```js,playground
console.log("Hello")
```

Now when you run the code (click the play button in the upper right corner of the code block), we should see the output "Hello". So what’s actually going on then and how does this work? Well, that’s what the rest of this lesson will teach you! For now, try changing the code, re-running the program, and see what happens.
